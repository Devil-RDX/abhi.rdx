 Hi, My name is <strong><i>Abhishek Verma</i></strong>.This is my first demo of my website.I have started web development as specialization for my future as it is an intersting field and lots of company demand for it. I always had a keen interest in computer science or data science. As a kid I always wanted to become a game designer but was not that easy as I thought it would be.
 <br>
 Being all alone during my childhood I learned to deal with lonliness which leaded to depression.I had lot of friends but never wanted to indulge with them.Due to my father's dominating nature, i feel that somehow I have a dominating nature too. As my love life was going to hell after my high school graduation, depression dominated over my daily life. But still to fulfill my father's dream i studied and was able to <strong>crack the IIT advance paper </strong> but was not able get a seat in computer science branch.<br>
 Taking a drop year in my academics was not an option but my family members & relatives forced me as <strong>they thought I had a mind for cracking it again.</strong>
